Once the user runs the code they will see the first two cards total and one card from the dealer. The user will decide whether to add one more card by typing “H” or stay with two cards he has right now by typing ”S”. If the users want to quit, they can type ”Q”.
Then, the user will compare what he has between the dealer to check if he wins or not.
If the user point value is smaller than the dealer then the user loses.
if the user point value is bigger than the dealer than the user wins.
Typing Q will also prompt the win/loss chart.
